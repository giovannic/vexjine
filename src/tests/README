######## VEX CORE TESTING DIRECTORY ########

The purpose of this directory is to offer a few basic test cases for the core of VEX, without any interference from bytecode instrumentation and the JVM. The tests here invoke directly the methods of libvex.so.

Tests:

======= perftest =======
Basic performance tests for the fundamental method instrumentation functionalities. Note: edit the "options" file, before starting the program.
./perftest methods vex     ### nanoseconds that VEX measures due to the invocation of the method instruments (when it should actually measure 0).
./perftest io vex	   ### nanoseconds that VEX measures due to the invocation of the I/O method instruments (when it should actually measure 0).

See also ./testOverhead for a demo usage.

./perftest loops1	   ### execution of a loop with method1 in real time (normal execution). Report of test duration
./perftest loops1 vex	   ### execution of a loop with method1 in virtual time (with VEX). Report of test duration

The discrepancy between the latter two is due to the VEX instrumentation overhead which should be compensated by using the former two results.

See also ./testCompensation for a demo usage.

======= randomprogram =======
Creates a random program simulating "loops" and "I/O operations" in a random order. It allows for scaling of methods in the test and threads. Note: edit the "options" file, before starting the program. 

Run ./testVexCoreWithRandomProgram for details on the parameters of  ./randomprogram.
 
./testVexCoreWithRandomProgram 1 400 "file=options" 1   ### use 1 thread to run tests with 200, 300 and 400 random methods using the "options" in file. 


======= pagefault =======
Touches various pages in memory (consumes lots of memory) to create major page faults. It is used to demonstrate that VEX does not capture page faults accurately.

See also ./testPageFault for usage.
